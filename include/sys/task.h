/* Task Priorities for the Weighted Round-Robin Scheduler.
 *
 * A task's priority is encoded in a 16-bit value:
 * - bits 15-8: Base Priority (Static). This determines the task's "weight".
 *              A lower value means higher priority.
 * - bits  7-0: Dynamic Priority (Counter). This is decremented by the
 * scheduler. A task becomes eligible to run when its counter reaches zero.
 *
 * When a task runs, its counter is reloaded from its base priority. This system
 * ensures that high-priority tasks (with low base values) run more frequently.
 * The enum values duplicate the base priority in both bytes for easy
 * initialization.
